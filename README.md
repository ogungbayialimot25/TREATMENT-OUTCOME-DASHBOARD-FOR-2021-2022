# TREATMENT-OUTCOME-DASHBOARD-FOR-2021-2022
Introduction

Treatment outcome datasets play a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and overall success of medical interventions. Analyzing this dataset provides valuable insights into how different treatments influence patient recovery, disease progression, and overall health outcomes. This type of analysis aids in identifying patterns, trends, and potential factors that affect treatment success or failure.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the treatment outcomes recorded in the dataset, which includes variables such as patient demographics, treatment types, treatment durations, and clinical outcomes. By conducting a systematic analysis, this study seeks to assess the effectiveness of the treatments and understand the factors contributing to both positive and negative patient outcomes.

Objectives

The main objectives of the treatment outcome dataset analysis are:

1. To examine the distribution of treatment outcomes across the patient population.


2. To assess the effectiveness of different treatments or interventions based on outcome measures (e.g., recovery, improvement, failure, mortality).


3. To identify key factors (e.g., age, gender, disease severity, comorbidities) associated with successful or unsuccessful treatment outcomes.


4. To analyze patterns and trends in treatment outcomes over time or across different patient subgroups.


5. To provide evidence-based recommendations for improving treatment strategies and patient care based on the findings from the dataset.

t by Doctor D. The analysis shows that Dr D recorded 38 failed treatment outcome with the cost of ₦203,930, 41 ongoing treatment outcome with the cost of ₦213,626and 29 recovered outcome with the cost of ₦155,093. Dr D had patient with different age group as follows: 1–10 amounting 15 patients ,11–20 amounting to 11 patients, 21–30 amounting to 9 patients, 31–40 amounting to 12 patients, 41–50 amounting to 12 patients , 51–60 amounting to 12 patients , 61–70 amounting to 7 patients, 71–80 amounting to 9 patients. 81–90 amounting to 9 patients. For each of the conditions, The analysis revealed that Dr D treated 32 patients for condition A, 38 patients for condition B, 38 patients for Condition C and None patient for condition D. The cost distribution by hospital for 2021: Hospital 1 generated ₦88,083, Hospital 2 generated ₦64,577and Hospital 3 generated ₦140,260 The Cost distribution by hospital for 2022: Hospital 1 generated ₦92,059, Hospital 2 generated ₦60,979 and Hospital 3 generated ₦98,205.

In Analysis Recommendation

Here are some genuine recommendations based on potential insights generated from analyzing the health dataset:

# Treatment Effectiveness

1. Develop treatment guidelines: Based on insights into most effective treatments, develop guidelines for healthcare providers to standardize care.
